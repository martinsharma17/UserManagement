/**
 * ⚠️ DEPRECATED ⚠️
 * 
 * This file (sidebarItems.jsx) is legacy code from the static menu system.
 * It is NO LONGER USED by the application.
 * 
 * The system is now 100% DYNAMIC:
 * 1. Backend: Defines menu in 'MenuSeeder.cs' and stores in database.
 * 2. Icons: All icons are now in 'SidebarIcons.jsx'.
 * 3. Logic: Dashboard.jsx fetches the menu dynamically from the database.
 * 
 * Please do not add new items here. Use 'MenuSeeder.cs' on the backend instead.
